## Welcome to vOS

vOS is like a bridge between your application and the host operating system.
You create an app once for your vOS, and all devices with your vOS installed will run it.
It's like Java without JVM.

And that's not all, vOS can be supplied with a whole desktop environment with multi-window management!

The project is still in development, so be patient or help us!
